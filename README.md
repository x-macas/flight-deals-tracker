# Welcome to flight-deals-tracker.

I have created this project using Tequila API service, for providing the flight details.
<br/>
I have included the feature of Authenticating with `OTP verfication`
<br/>
Using Sheety for accessing Google sheets can be very useful and easy, but there is a restriction of using maximum
number of API calls in a month, `so i used "customer_data.json" for storing customer's data`.
<br/>
I let this `customer_data.json` as empty file, but don't worry, it will work fine, if you will run the program, using catching exceptions technique.

Enjoy and have a nice day! ðŸ˜‡
